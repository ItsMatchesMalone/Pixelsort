## How to Use

1. Place your `.tiff` images inside the `Aphelion/` folder.
2. Open `pixel_sort.py` and configure:
   - `input_path`
   - `output_path`
   - `mode`: `"bright"` or `"dark"`
   - `threshold`: brightness threshold (0â€“255)
3. Run the script:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python pixel_sort.py
